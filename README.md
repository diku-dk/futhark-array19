# raster3d

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

Short example of 3D rasterizing a scene.

Requires [Futhark](http://futhark-lang.org) and SDL2 and SDL2-ttf
libraries with associated header files.

Uses the `expand` function from the https://github.com/diku-dk/segmented
package to draw the triangles and `reduce_by_index` to simulate a
z-buffer.  The interesting code lies in `raster3d.fut` in the
`render_projected_triangles` function.

There is room for improvement!


## Demo

Run `futhark pkg sync` once and then `make && ./demo` for an interactive
terrain explorer.  Requires SDL2 and SDL2-ttf C libraries with
associated header files.

Base controls:

  + Shift+other action: Move or turn faster
  + PageUp/PageDown: Increase/decrease draw distance
  + Tab: Change navigation controls (see below)
  + Ctrl+Tab: Change pixel coloring approach
  + F1: Toggle text
  + ESC: Exit (press once to exit the mouse grabbing, twice to exit the program)

Mouse controls for navigation (default):

  + Mouse: Move around
  + Ctrl+mouse: Move along the y axis instead of the z axis when moving
    the mouse horizontally
  + Space: Move forward

Keyboard controls for navigation:

  + Up/Down: Move forwards/backwards
  + Alt+Up/Down: Turn upwards/downwards
  + Left/Right: Turn left/right
  + Alt+Left/Right: Turn downwards left/right


## Notes

This demo was originally part of the
https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-array19 submission, but has been
reworked to work with newer Futhark.
